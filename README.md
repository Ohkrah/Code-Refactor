# Code Refracator

## Steps taken
The code refractor challenge required the change of the title of the webpage to be relevant to the webpage rather that what it was formerly labeled, 'title'. The next step was to ensure that there was an alternate image tag for each img element so that way the site could be more accessible to all users. After this the css was compared to the html to ensure that classes and elements showed up in a consistent order for easier readability/access. Comments were added throughout the process for code understandibility.
